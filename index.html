    <h2 class="color">Costume Process</h2>
    <p>Making a truly great costume starts with a vision, an inspiration, or a compelling event. It requires the confidence of leaping into the unknown and the dedication to spend many hours on getting everything exactly just so.</p>
    <h2>Practical Sources</h2>
    <p>There are many sources of practical advice for costumers, from excellent pattern companies such as <a href="https://www.trulyvictorian.net/">Truly Victorian</a> to great fabric stores like <a href="http://www.stonemountainfabric.com">Stonemountain and Daughter.  </a></p>

  <h2 class="color">The Fashionable Past is a Great comparison website </h2>
  <p>
  <a href="http://www.koshka-the-cat.com/">The Fashionable Past</a> is a costuming website I've followed for years. I like it because it is well organized and has individual pages about each costume project <a href="http://www.koshka-the-cat.com/chemise_dress.html">Here</a> is an example. When inspecting the source, I saw that it is a kind of retro style page in many ways, including mixing HTML and CSS together in the same document and using tables for layout rather than something more modern like flexbox or even floats.
